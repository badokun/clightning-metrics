# Lightning Dashboard

Follow the instructions at [Performance Monitoring on a Raspberry](https://github.com/badokun/lightning-metrics/blob/master/docs/performance_monitoring.md).

> This guide was created to track an LND node's metrics, so you may ignore the *Lightning Metrics* section as it only pertains to LND.

Once completed proceed with setting up the c-lighting metrics dashboard.
